   Description: Some global #defines for setting behavior across all
     of the applications.

   In the beginning every application set all of their configuration options
   in a local configuration file, and this file was used for basically just
   turning trace on or off globally.  Patterns of settings emerged; the UDP
   application generally had fewer buffers, the server applications did not
   include UDP or DNS but used many buffers, and the client TCP applications
   needed everything.

   The set of options chosen here is a reasonable set for most applications.
   Specific applications will probably want to change the number of packet
   buffers, TCP sockets and TCP transmit buffers as needed.  But the rest of
   the settings are probably sane.


   Changes:

   2011-05-27: Initial release as open source software
   2014-05-25: Restructure to include more seldom changed configuration
               options here, and only override if needed in individual
               applications.
   2015-01-10: Add PACKET_HANDLERS define
